## Overview

Machine learning-based tools such as [DeepLabCut](dlc:) and [SLEAP](sleap:)
have become commonplace for tracking the movements of animals and their body
parts in videos. However, there is still a need for a standardized, easy-to-use method
to process the tracks generated by these tools.

``movement`` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analyzing
motion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualization,
and motion quantification. We aim to support all popular animal tracking
frameworks and common file formats.
