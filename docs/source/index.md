## Overview

Deep learning methods for motion tracking have revolutionised a range of
scientific disciplines, from neuroscience and biomechanics, to conservation
and ethology. Tools such as [DeepLabCut](dlc:) and [SLEAP](sleap:)
now allow researchers to track animal movements
in videos with remarkable accuracy, without requiring physical markers.
However, there is still a need for standardised, easy-to-use methods
to process the tracks generated by these tools.

`movement` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analysing
motion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualisation,
and motion quantification. We aim to support all popular animal tracking
frameworks and file formats.
