## Overview

Pose estimation tools, such as [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) are now commonplace when processing video data of animal behaviour. There is not yet a standardised, easy-to-use way to process the *pose tracks* produced from these software packages.

movement aims to provide a consistent modular interface to analyse pose tracks, allowing steps such as data cleaning, visualisation and motion quantification.
We aim to support a range of pose estimation packages, along with 2D or 3D tracking of single or multiple animals.
