# Getting Started

## Installation

We recommend you install movement inside a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) environment.
In the following we assume you have `conda` installed,
but the same commands will also work with `mamba`/`micromamba`.


First, create and activate an environment.
You can call your environment whatever you like, we've used "movement-env".

```sh
conda create -n movement-env -c conda-forge python=3.10 pytables
conda activate movement-env
```

Next install the `movement` package:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Users
To get the latest release from PyPI:

```sh
pip install movement
```
If you have an older version of `movement` installed in the same environment,
you can update to the latest version with:

```sh
pip install --upgrade movement
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Developers
To get the latest development version, clone the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/)
and then run from inside the repository:

```sh
pip install -e .[dev]  # works on most shells
pip install -e '.[dev]'  # works on zsh (the default shell on macOS)
```

This will install the package in editable mode, including all `dev` dependencies.
Please see the [contributing guide](target-contributing) for more information.

## Loading data
You can load predicted pose tracks from the pose estimation software packages
[DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) or [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/).

First import the `movement.io.load_poses` module:

```python
from movement.io import load_poses
```

Then, use the `from_dlc_file` or `from_sleap_file` functions to load the data.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} SLEAP

Load from [SLEAP analysis files](https://sleap.ai/tutorials/analysis.html) (`.h5`):
```python
ds = load_poses.from_sleap_file("/path/to/file.analysis.h5", fps=30)
```
:::

:::{tab-item} DeepLabCut

Load pose estimation outputs from `.h5` files:
```python
ds = load_poses.from_dlc_file("/path/to/file.h5", fps=30)
```

You may also load `.csv` files (assuming they are formatted as DeepLabCut expects them):
```python
ds = load_poses.from_dlc_file("/path/to/file.csv", fps=30)
```

If you have already imported the data into a pandas DataFrame, you can
convert it to a movement dataset with:
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_hdf("/path/to/file.h5")
ds = load_poses.from_dlc_df(df, fps=30)
```
:::

You can also try movement out on some sample data included in the package.

:::{dropdown} Fetching sample data
:color: primary
:icon: unlock

You can view the available sample data files with:

```python
from movement import datasets

file_names = datasets.list_pose_data()
print(file_names)
```
This will print a list of file names containing sample pose data.
The files are prefixed with the name of the pose estimation software package,
either "DLC" or "SLEAP".

To get the path to one of the sample files,
you can use the `fetch_pose_data_path` function:

```python
file_path = datasets.fetch_pose_data_path("DLC_two-mice.predictions.csv")
```
The first time you call this function, it will download the corresponding file
to your local machine and save it in the `~/.movement/data` directory. On
subsequent calls, it will simply return the path to that local file.

You can feed the path to the `from_dlc_file` or `from_sleap_file` functions
and load the data, as shown above.

## Working with movement datasets

Loaded pose estimation data are represented in movement as
[`xarray.Dataset`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html) objects.

You can view information about the loaded dataset by printing it:
```python
ds = load_poses.from_dlc_file("/path/to/file.h5", fps=30)
print(ds)
```
If you are working in a Jupyter notebook, you can also view an interactive
representation of the dataset by simply typing its name - e.g. `ds` - in a cell.

### Dataset structure

The movement `xarray.Dataset` has the following dimensions:
- `time`: the number of frames in the video
- `individuals`: the number of individuals in the video
- `keypoints`: the number of keypoints in the skeleton
- `space`: the number of spatial dimensions, either 2 or 3

Appropriate coordinate labels are assigned to each dimension:
list of unique names (str) for `individuals` and `keypoints`,
['x','y',('z')] for `space`. The coordinates of the `time` dimension are
in seconds if `fps` is provided, otherwise they are in frame numbers.

The dataset contains two data variables stored as
[`xarray.DataArray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.DataArray.html#xarray.DataArray) objects:
- `pose_tracks`: with shape (`time`, `individuals`, `keypoints`, `space`)
- `confidence`: with shape (`time`, `individuals`, `keypoints`)

You can think of a `DataArray` as a `numpy.ndarray` with `pandas`-style
indexing and labelling. To learn more about `xarray` data structures, see the
relevant [documentation](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/data-structures.html).

The dataset may also contain the following attributes as metadata:
- `fps`: the number of frames per second in the video
- `time_unit`: the unit of the `time` coordinates, frames or seconds
- `source_software`: the software from which the pose tracks were loaded
- `source_file`: the file from which the pose tracks were loaded

### Indexing and selection
You can access the data variables and attributes of the dataset as follows:
```python
pose_tracks = ds.pose_tracks  # ds["pose_tracks"] also works
confidence = ds.confidence

fps = ds.fps   # ds.attrs["fps"] also works
```

You can select subsets of the data using the `sel` method:
```python
# select the first 100 seconds of data
ds_sel = ds.sel(time=slice(0, 100))

# select specific individuals or keypoints
ds_sel = ds.sel(individuals=["individual1", "individual2"])
ds_sel = ds.sel(keypoints="snout")

# combine selections
ds_sel = ds.sel(time=slice(0, 100), individuals=["individual1", "individual2"], keypoints="snout")
```
All of the above selections can also be applied to the data variables,
resulting in a `DataArray` rather than a `Dataset`:

```python
pose_tracks = ds.pose_tracks.sel(individuals="individual1", keypoints="snout")
```
You may also use all the other powerful [indexing and selection](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/indexing.html) methods provided by `xarray`.

### Plotting

You can also use the built-in [`xarray` plotting methods](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/plotting.html)
to visualise the data. Check out the [Load and explore pose tracks](./examples/load_and_explore_poses.rst)
example for inspiration.

## Saving data
You can save movement datasets to disk in a variety of formats.
Currently, only saving to DeepLabCut-style files is supported.

```python
from movement.io import save_poses

save_poses.to_dlc_file(ds, "/path/to/file.h5")  # preferred
save_poses.to_dlc_file(ds, "/path/to/file.csv")
```

Instead of saving to file directly, you can also convert the dataset to a
DeepLabCut-style `pandas.DataFrame` first:
```python
df = save_poses.to_dlc_df(ds)
```
and then save it to file using any `pandas` method, e.g. `to_hdf` or `to_csv`.
