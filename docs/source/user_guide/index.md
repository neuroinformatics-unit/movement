# User Guide

Start by [installing the package](installation.md) and
[loading your own tracking data](input_output.md), or playing with some
[sample data](target-sample-data) provided with the package.

Before you dive deeper, we highly recommend reading about the structure
and usage of [movement datasets](movement_dataset.md), which are a central
concept in the package.
