Contributions to movement are absolutely encouraged, whether to fix a bug,
develop a new feature, or improve the documentation.
To help you get started, we have prepared a statement on the project's [mission and scope](target-mission),
a [roadmap](target-roadmap) outlining our current priorities, and a detailed [contributing guide](target-contributing).
