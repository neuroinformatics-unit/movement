# Community

`movement` is made possible by the generous contributions of [many people](target-people).

We welcome and encourage contributions in any form—whether it is fixing a bug,
developing a new feature, or improving the documentation—as long as you follow our
[code-of-conduct](movement-github:#coc-ov-file).

To help you get started, we have prepared a statement on the project's [mission and scope](target-mission),
a [roadmap](target-roadmaps) outlining our current priorities, and a detailed [contributing guide](target-contributing).
