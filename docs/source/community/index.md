# Community

`movement` is made possible by the generous contributions of [many people](target-people).

We welcome and encourage contributions in any form—whether it is fixing a bug,
developing a new feature, or improving the documentation—as long as you follow our
[code of conduct](target-code-of-conduct).

To help you get started, we have prepared a list of resources and guidelines. Connect with us
through our [communication channels](target-connect-with-us) if you have any questions or need assistance.
