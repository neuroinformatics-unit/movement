# Before you start

Before starting work on a contribution, please check the [issue tracker](movement-github:issues) to see if there's already an issue describing what you have in mind.

- If there is, add a comment to let others know you're willing to work on it.
- If there isn't, please create a new issue to describe your idea.

We strongly encourage discussing your plans before you start coding—either in the issue itself or on our [Zulip chat](movement-zulip:).
This helps avoid duplicated effort and ensures your work aligns with the project's [scope](target-mission) and [roadmap](target-roadmaps).

Keep in mind that we use issues liberally to track development.
Some may be vague or aspirational, serving as reminders for future work rather than tasks ready to be tackled.
There are a few reasons an issue might not be actionable yet:

- It depends on other issues being resolved first.
- It hasn't been clearly scoped. In such cases, helping to clarify the scope or breaking the issue into smaller parts can be a valuable contribution. Maintainers typically lead this process, but you're welcome to participate in the discussion.
- It doesn't currently fit into the roadmap or the maintainers' priorities, meaning we may be unable to commit to timely guidance and prompt code reviews.

If you're unsure whether an issue is ready to work on, just ask!

Some issues are labelled as ``good first issue``.
These are especially suitable if you're new to the project, and we recommend starting there.
