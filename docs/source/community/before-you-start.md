## Why contribute?

Contributing to `movement` is a way to directly shape a tool you use in your own research—fixing
a bug that affects your workflow, adding a feature you need, or improving the documentation for
others in your field. Along the way, you gain practical experience with Python, git, and GitHub,
and receive feedback from maintainers through code review.

Contributions also have a broader impact. Every improvement makes the software more robust,
reproducible, and useful to the wider behavioural analysis community—helping to avoid duplicated
effort across research groups and accelerating scientific discovery.

There are many ways to get involved beyond writing code: reporting bugs, improving documentation,
contributing sample datasets, or helping others learn to use `movement` all make a real difference.
We welcome contributions at all levels of experience.

All contributors are acknowledged in our release notes and added to our [People](target-people)
page (refreshed monthly).

## Choosing what to work on
Before starting work on a contribution, please check the [issue tracker](movement-github:issues) to see if there's already an issue describing what you have in mind.

- If there is, add a comment to let others know you're willing to work on it.
- If there isn't, please create a new issue to describe your idea.

::: {tip}
We strongly encourage discussing your plans before you start coding—either in the issue itself or on our [Zulip chat](movement-zulip:).
This helps avoid duplicated effort and ensures your work aligns with the project's [scope](target-mission) and [roadmap](target-roadmaps).
Where possible, keep discussions public — Zulip and GitHub are preferred over direct messages, so the whole community can benefit.
See our [team communication guidelines](https://neuroinformatics.dev/get-involved/development_guidelines.html#communication) for more.
:::

Keep in mind that we use issues liberally to track development.
Some may be vague or aspirational, serving as reminders for future work rather than tasks ready to be tackled.
There are a few reasons an issue might not be actionable yet:

- It depends on other issues being resolved first.
- It hasn't been clearly scoped. In such cases, helping to clarify the scope or breaking the issue into smaller parts can be a valuable contribution. Maintainers typically lead this process, but you're welcome to participate in the discussion.
- It doesn't currently fit into the roadmap or the maintainers' priorities, meaning we may be unable to commit to timely guidance and prompt code reviews.

If you're unsure whether an issue is ready to work on, just ask!

Some issues are labelled as ``good first issue``.
These are especially suitable if you're new to the project, and we recommend starting there.

## Working with maintainers

We will do our best to provide timely and constructive feedback on your contributions.
However, we are a small team with many other commitments, so please be patient if you don't hear back immediately.
We receive notifications for all activity in the repository, so avoid pinging maintainers directly unless you haven't received any response for over two weeks or something is truly urgent.

Please also make sure your contributions follow our [code of conduct](target-code-of-conduct) and our [team's policy on using AI](https://neuroinformatics.dev/get-involved/ai_policy.html). Contributions that don't may be closed without further review.
