# movement end-of-year updates

_This is our inaugaural blogpost, with a summary of the latest `v0.0.21` release and a preview of what's coming next in 2025._

From now on, we'll be using this blog to post updates
about releases, community news, or the occasional technical deep dive.

## What's new in movement v0.0.21?

This release packs many new features and improvements,
which we are excited to share with you.

See our [installation guide](target-installation) for instructions on how to
install the latest version or upgrade from an existing installation.

## Looking to v0.1 and beyond

Over the last 1.5 years, we have gradually built up the core functionalities we envisioned for `movement` version `v0.1`,
as described in our [roadmap](target-roadmaps).
These have included [input/output support](target-io) for a few popular animal tracking frameworks, as well as methods for data cleaning and computing kinematic variables.

What we're still missing is a [napari](napari:) plugin for `movement`, which we envision both as an interactive visualisation framework for motion tracking data as well as a graphical user interface for `movement`.
We have been working on a minimal version of this plugin for a while and are expecting to ship it as part of the `v0.1` release in early 2025.

After `v0.1`, we'll be switching to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), as it applies to MINOR (new features) and PATCH (bug fixes) versions. Until we are ready for a `v1` MAJOR version, we cannot commit to backward compatibility, but any breaking changes will be clearly communicated in the release notes.

## Announcing movement Community Calls

We are committed to fostering openness, transparency, and a strong sense of
community within the `movement` project.
Starting next year, we will host regular Community Calls via Zoom.

The calls will take place every second Friday from **11:00 to 11:45 GMT**,
beginning on **10 January 2025**.
These calls are open to anyone interested in contributing to `movement` or
sharing feedback on the project's progress and direction.

A few days before each call, we will post an announcement on Zulip with the Zoom link and agenda.
We encourage everyone who's interested in
joining to follow this [Zulip topic](movement-community-calls:)
to stay updated.
