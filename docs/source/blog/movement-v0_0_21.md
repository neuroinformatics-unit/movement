# movement end-of-year updates

_This is our inaugaural blogpost, marked by the occasion of
releasing `movement` version `v0.0.21`._

## Announcing movement Community Calls

We are committed to fostering openness, transparency, and a strong sense of
community within the `movement` project.
Starting next year, we will host regular Community Calls via Zoom.

The calls will take place every second Friday from **11:00 to 11:45 GMT**,
beginning on **10 January 2025**.
These calls are open to anyone interested in contributing to `movement` or
sharing feedback on the project's progress and direction.

A few days before each call, we will post an announcement on
[Zulip](movement-zulip:) with the Zoom link and agenda.
We encourage everyone who's interested in
joining to follow this [Zulip topic](movement-community-calls:)
to stay updated.

## What's new in `movement` v0.0.21?

This release packs many new features and improvements,
which we are excited to share with you.

See our [installation guide](target-installation) for instructions on how to
install the latest version or upgrade from an existing installation.

## What's with the blog?

We are excited to launch our blog, where we will share
important updates and news about `movement`. You can
