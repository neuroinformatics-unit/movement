# Getting Started

Start by [installing the package](installation.md).

After that try [loading some of your own predicted poses](target-loading),
from one of the [supported formats](target-formats).
Alternatively, you can use the [sample data](target-sample-data)
provided with the package.

Once you have loaded some data, feel free to explore the structure and
usage of [movement datasets](movement_dataset.md), which are a central
concept in the package.
