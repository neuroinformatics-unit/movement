# The
# `arena <https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/aeon_docs/reference/hardware/habitat.html>`_
# is divided up into three main sub-regions. The cuboidal structure
# on the right-hand-side of the arena is the nest of the three individuals
# taking part in the experiment. The majority of the arena is an open
# octadecagonal (18-sided) shape, which is the bright central region that
# encompasses most of the image. This central region is surrounded by a
# (comparatively thin) "ring", which links the central region to the nest.
# In this example, we will look at how we can use the functionality for regions
# of interest (RoIs) provided by ``movement`` to analyse our sample dataset.

# %%
# Define regions of interest
# --------------------------
# In order to ask questions about the behaviour of our individuals with respect
# to the arena, we first need to define the RoIs to represent the separate
# pieces of our arena programmatically. Since each part of our arena is
# two-dimensional, we will use a ``PolygonOfInterest`` to describe each of
# them.
#
# In the future, the
# `movement plugin for napari <../user_guide/gui.md>`_
# will support creating regions of interest by clicking points and drawing
# shapes in the napari GUI. For the time being, we can still define our RoIs
# by specifying the points that make up the interior and exterior boundaries.
# So first, let's define the boundary vertices of our various regions.

# The centre of the arena is located roughly here
centre = np.array([712.5, 541])
# The "width" (distance between the inner and outer octadecagonal rings) is 40
# pixels wide
ring_width = 40.0
# The distance between opposite vertices of the outer ring is 1090 pixels
ring_extent = 1090.0

n_pts = 18

        for i in range(n_pts)
    ],
    dtype=complex,

# Then stretch and translate the reference to match our arena

# To create the appropriate RoI, we just pass the coordinates in either
# clockwise or counter-clockwise order.

# Compute the distance to the nest

# Defining RoIs means that we can efficiently extract information from our data

# For example, we might be interested in how the distance between an
# individual and the nest region changes over the course of the experiment. We
# can query the ``nest_region`` that we created for this information.

# We can see that the ``AEON38_TP2`` individual appears to be moving towards
# the nest during the experiment, whilst the other two individuals are
# moving away from the nest. The "plateau" in the figure between frames 200-400
# is when the individuals meet in the ``ring_region``, and remain largely
# stationary in a group until they can pass each other.
#
# One other thing to note is that ``compute_distance_to`` is returning the
# distance "as the crow flies" to the ``nest_region``. This means that
# structures potentially in the way (such as the ``ring_region`` walls) are not
# accounted for in this distance calculation. Further to this, the "distance to
# a RoI" should always be understood as "the distance from a point to the
# closest point within an RoI".
#
# If we wanted to check the direction of closest approach to a region, referred
# to as the **approach vector**, we can use the ``compute_approach_vector``
# method.
# The distances that we computed via ``compute_distance_to`` are just the
# magnitudes of the approach vectors.

# The ``boundary_only`` keyword
# -----------------------------
# From our plot of the distances to the nest, we saw a time-window
# in which the individuals are grouped up, possibly trying to pass each other
# as they approach from different directions.
# We might be interested in whether they move to opposite walls of the ring
# while doing so. To examine this, we can plot the distance between each
# individual and the ``ring_region``, using the same commands as above.
#
# However, we get something slightly unexpected:

# the boundary of the region, not inside it.
# Note that for 1D regions (``LineOfInterest``), the "boundary" is just the
# endpoints of the line.

# can't tell if the individuals do move to opposite walls when passing each
# other. Instead, let's ask for the distance  to just the exterior wall.

# This output is much more helpful. We see that the individuals are largely the
# same distance from the exterior wall during frames 250-350, and then notice
# that;
#
# - Individual ``AEON_TP1`` moves far away from the exterior wall,
# - ``AEON3B_NTP`` moves almost up to the exterior wall,
# - and ``AEON3B_TP2`` seems to remain between the other two individuals.
#
# After frame 400, the individuals appear to go back to chaotic distances from
# the exterior wall again, which is consistent with them having passed each
# other in the ``ring_region`` and once again having the entire width of the
# ring to explore.

# %%
# Boundary angles
# ---------------
# Having observed the individuals' behaviour as they pass one another in the
# ``ring_region``, we can begin to ask questions about their orientation with
# respect to the nest. ``movement`` currently supports the computation of two
# such "boundary angles";
#
# - The **allocentric boundary angle**. Given a region of interest :math:`R`,
#   reference vector :math:`\vec{r}` (such as global north), and a position
#   :math:`p` in space (e.g. the position of an individual), the allocentric
#   boundary angle is the signed angle between the approach vector from
#   :math:`p` to :math:`R`, and :math:`\vec{r}`.
# - The **egocentric boundary angle**. Given a region of interest :math:`R`, a
#   forward vector :math:`\vec{f}` (e.g. the direction of travel of an
#   individual), and the point of origin of :math:`\vec{f}` denoted :math:`p`
#   (e.g. the individual's current position), the egocentric boundary angle is
#   the signed angle between the approach vector from :math:`p` to :math:`R`,
#   and :math:`\vec{f}`.
#
# Note that egocentric angles are generally computed with changing frames of
# reference in mind - the forward vector may be varying in time as the
# individual moves around the arena. By contrast, allocentric angles are always
# computed with respect to some fixed reference frame.
#
# For the purposes of our example, we will define our "forward vector" as the
# velocity vector between successive time-points, for each individual - we can
# compute this from ``positions`` using the ``compute_velocity`` function in
# ``movement.kinematics``.
# We will also define our reference frame, or "global north" direction, to be
# the direction of the positive x-axis.

forward_vector = compute_velocity(positions)
global_north = np.array([1.0, 0.0])

allocentric_angles = nest_region.compute_allocentric_angle_to_nearest_point(
    positions,
    reference_vector=global_north,
    in_degrees=True,
)
egocentric_angles = nest_region.compute_egocentric_angle_to_nearest_point(
    forward_vector,
    positions[:-1],
    in_degrees=True,
)

angle_plot, angle_ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
allo_ax, ego_ax = angle_ax

for mouse_name, col in mouse_names_and_colours:
    allo_ax.plot(
        allocentric_angles.sel(individuals=mouse_name),
        c=col,
        label=mouse_name,
    )
    ego_ax.plot(

angle_plot.show()

# %%
# Allocentric angles show step-like behaviour because they only depend on an
# individual's position relative to the RoI, not their forward vector. This
# makes the allocentric angle graph resemble the distance-to-nest graph
# (inverted on the y-axis), with a "plateau" during frames 200-400 when the
# individuals are (largely) stationary while passing each other.
#
# Egocentric angles, on the other hand, fluctuate more due to their sensitivity
# to changes in the forward vector. Outside frames 200-400, we see trends:
#
# - ``AEON3B_TP2`` moves counter-clockwise around the ring, so its egocentric
#   angle decreases ever so slightly with time - almost hitting an angle of 0
#   degrees as it moves along the direction of closest approach after passing
#   the other individuals.
# - The other two individuals move clockwise, so their angles show a
#   gradual increase with time. Because the two individuals occasionally get in
#   each others' way, we see frequent "spikes" in their egocentric angles as
#   their forward vectors rapidly change.
#
# During frames 200-400, rapid changes in direction cause large fluctuations in
# the egocentric angles of all the individuals, reflecting the individuals'
# attempts to avoid colliding with (and to make space to move passed) each
# other.
