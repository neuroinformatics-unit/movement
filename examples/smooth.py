# Load a sample dataset

# Let's load a sample dataset and print it to inspect its contents.
# Note that if you are running this notebook interactively, you can simply
# type the variable name (here ``ds_wasp``) in a cell to get an interactive
# display of the dataset's contents.

# We see that the dataset contains the 2D pose tracks and confidence scores
# for a single wasp, generated with DeepLabCut. The wasp is tracked at two
# keypoints: "head" and "stinger" in a video that was recorded at 40 fps and
# lasts for approximately 27 seconds.

# Define a plotting function
# --------------------------
# Let's define a plotting function to help us visualise the effects of

# The function takes as inputs two datasets containing raw and smooth data
# respectively, and plots the position time series and power spectral density
# (PSD) for a given individual and keypoint. The function also allows you to
# specify the spatial coordinate (``x`` or ``y``) and a time range to focus on.

# Smoothing with a median filter
# ------------------------------
# Using the :func:`movement.filtering.median_filter` function on the
# ``position`` data variable, we can apply a rolling window median filter
# over a 0.1-second window (4 frames) to the wasp dataset.
# As the ``window`` parameter is defined in *number of observations*,
# we can simply multiply the desired time window by the frame rate
# of the video. We will also create a copy of the dataset to avoid
# modifying the original data.

window = int(0.1 * ds_wasp.fps)
ds_wasp_smooth = ds_wasp.copy()
ds_wasp_smooth.update({"position": median_filter(ds_wasp.position, window)})

# %%
# We see from the printed report that the dataset has no missing values
# neither before nor after smoothing. Let's visualise the effects of the
# median filter in the time and frequency domains.

plot_raw_and_smooth_timeseries_and_psd(
    ds_wasp, ds_wasp_smooth, keypoint="stinger"
)

# %%
# We see that the median filter has removed the "spikes" present around the
# 14 second mark in the raw data. However, it has not dealt the big shift
# occurring during the final second. In the frequency domain, we can see that
# the filter has reduced the power in the high-frequency components, without
# affecting the low frequency components.
#
# This illustrates what the median filter is good at: removing brief "spikes"
# (e.g. a keypoint abruptly jumping to a different location for a frame or two)
# and high-frequency "jitter" (often present due to pose estimation
# working on a per-frame basis).

# %%
# Choosing parameters for the median filter
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We can control the behaviour of the median filter
# via two parameters: ``window`` and ``min_periods``.
# To better understand the effect of these parameters, let's use a
# dataset that contains missing values.

ds_mouse = sample_data.fetch_dataset("SLEAP_single-mouse_EPM.analysis.h5")
print(ds_mouse)

# %%
# The dataset contains a single mouse with six keypoints tracked in
# 2D space. The video was recorded at 30 fps and lasts for ~616 seconds. We can
# see that there are some missing values, indicated as "nan" in the
# printed dataset.
# Let's apply the median filter over a 0.1-second window (3 frames)
# to the dataset.

window = int(0.1 * ds_mouse.fps)
ds_mouse_smooth = ds_mouse.copy()
ds_mouse_smooth.update({"position": median_filter(ds_mouse.position, window)})

# %%
# The report informs us that the raw data contains NaN values, most of which
# occur at the ``snout`` and ``tail_end`` keypoints. After filtering, the
# number of NaNs has increased. This is because the default behaviour of the
# median filter is to propagate NaN values, i.e. if any value in the rolling
# window is NaN, the output will also be NaN.
#
# To modify this behaviour, you can set the value of the ``min_periods``
# parameter to an integer value. This parameter determines the minimum number
# of non-NaN values required in the window for the output to be non-NaN.
# For example, setting ``min_periods=2`` means that two non-NaN values in the
# window are sufficient for the median to be calculated. Let's try this.

ds_mouse_smooth.update(
    {"position": median_filter(ds_mouse.position, window, min_periods=2)}
)

# %%
# We see that this time the number of NaN values has decreased
# across all keypoints.
# Let's visualise the effects of the median filter in the time and frequency
# domains. Here we focus on the first 80 seconds for the ``snout`` keypoint.
# You can adjust the ``keypoint`` and ``time_range`` arguments to explore other
# parts of the data.

plot_raw_and_smooth_timeseries_and_psd(
    ds_mouse, ds_mouse_smooth, keypoint="snout", time_range=slice(0, 80)
)

# %%
# The smoothing once again reduces the power of high-frequency components, but
# the resulting time series stays quite close to the raw data.
#
# What happens if we increase the ``window`` to 2 seconds (60 frames)?

window = int(2 * ds_mouse.fps)
ds_mouse_smooth.update(
    {"position": median_filter(ds_mouse.position, window, min_periods=2)}
)

# %%
# The number of NaN values has decreased even further.
# That's because the chance of finding at least 2 valid values within
# a 2-second window (i.e. 60 frames) is quite high.
# Let's plot the results for the same keypoint and time range
# as before.

plot_raw_and_smooth_timeseries_and_psd(
    ds_mouse, ds_mouse_smooth, keypoint="snout", time_range=slice(0, 80)
)
# %%
# We see that the filtered time series is much smoother and it has even
# "bridged" over some small gaps. That said, it often deviates from the raw
# data, in ways that may not be desirable, depending on the application.
# Here, our choice of ``window`` may be too large.
# In general, you should choose a ``window`` that is small enough to
# preserve the original data structure, but large enough to remove
# "spikes" and high-frequency noise. Always inspect the results to ensure
# that the filter is not removing important features.

# %%
# Smoothing with a Savitzky-Golay filter
# --------------------------------------
# Here we apply the :func:`movement.filtering.savgol_filter` function
# (a wrapper around :func:`scipy.signal.savgol_filter`), to the ``position``
# data variable.
# The Savitzky-Golay filter is a polynomial smoothing filter that can be
# applied to time series data on a rolling window basis.
# A polynomial with a degree specified by ``polyorder`` is applied to each
# data segment defined by the size ``window``.
# The value of the polynomial at the midpoint of each ``window`` is then
# used as the output value.
#
# Let's try it on the mouse dataset, this time using a 0.2-second
# window (i.e. 6 frames) and the default ``polyorder=2`` for smoothing.
# As before, we first compute the corresponding number of observations
# to be used as the ``window`` size.

window = int(0.2 * ds_mouse.fps)
ds_mouse_smooth.update({"position": savgol_filter(ds_mouse.position, window)})

# %%
# We see that the number of NaN values has increased after filtering. This is
# for the same reason as with the median filter (in its default mode), i.e.
# if there is at least one NaN value in the window, the output will be NaN.
# Unlike the median filter, the Savitzky-Golay filter does not provide a
# ``min_periods`` parameter to control this behaviour. Let's visualise the
# effects in the time and frequency domains.

plot_raw_and_smooth_timeseries_and_psd(
    ds_mouse, ds_mouse_smooth, keypoint="snout", time_range=slice(0, 80)
)
# %%
# Once again, the power of high-frequency components has been reduced, but more
# missing values have been introduced.

# %%
# Now let's apply the same Savitzky-Golay filter to the wasp dataset.

window = int(0.2 * ds_wasp.fps)
ds_wasp_smooth.update({"position": savgol_filter(ds_wasp.position, window)})

# %%
plot_raw_and_smooth_timeseries_and_psd(
    ds_wasp, ds_wasp_smooth, keypoint="stinger"
)
# %%
# This example shows two important limitations of the Savitzky-Golay filter.
# First, the filter can introduce artefacts around sharp boundaries. For
# example, focus on what happens around the sudden drop in position
# during the final second. Second, the PSD appears to have large periodic
# drops at certain frequencies. Both of these effects vary with the
# choice of ``window`` and ``polyorder``. You can read more about these
# and other limitations of the Savitzky-Golay filter in
# `this paper <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.1c00054>`_.


# %%
# Combining multiple smoothing filters
# ------------------------------------
# We can also combine multiple smoothing filters by applying them
# sequentially. For example, we can first apply the median filter with a small
# ``window`` to remove "spikes" and then apply the Savitzky-Golay filter
# with a larger ``window`` to further smooth the data.
# Between the two filters, we can interpolate over small gaps to avoid the
# excessive proliferation of NaN values. Let's try this on the mouse dataset.

# First, we will apply the median filter.
window = int(0.1 * ds_mouse.fps)
ds_mouse_smooth.update(
    {"position": median_filter(ds_mouse.position, window, min_periods=2)}
)

# Next, let's linearly interpolate over gaps smaller
# than 1 second (30 frames).
ds_mouse_smooth.update(
    {"position": interpolate_over_time(ds_mouse_smooth.position, max_gap=30)}
)

# Finally, let's apply the Savitzky-Golay filter
# over a 0.4-second window (12 frames).
window = int(0.4 * ds_mouse.fps)
ds_mouse_smooth.update(
    {"position": savgol_filter(ds_mouse_smooth.position, window)}
)

# %%
# A record of all applied operations is stored in the ``log`` attribute of the
# ``ds_mouse_smooth.position`` data array. Let's inspect it to summarise
# what we've done.

for entry in ds_mouse_smooth.position.log:
    print(entry)

# %%
# Now let's visualise the difference between the raw data and the final
# smoothed result.

plot_raw_and_smooth_timeseries_and_psd(
    ds_mouse,
    ds_mouse_smooth,
    keypoint="snout",
    time_range=slice(0, 80),
)

# Feel free to play around with the parameters of the applied filters and to
# also look at other keypoints and time ranges.
