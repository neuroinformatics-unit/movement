# %matplotlib widget

# Load sample dataset
# ------------------------
# First, we load an example dataset. In this case, we select the
# ``SLEAP_three-mice_Aeon_proofread`` sample data.
ds = sample_data.fetch_dataset(

# %%
# We can see in the printed description of the dataset ``ds`` that
# the data was acquired at 50 fps, and the time axis is expressed in seconds.
# It includes data for three individuals(``AEON3B_NTP``, ``AEON3B_TP1``,
# and ``AEON3B_TP2``), and only one keypoint called ``centroid`` was tracked
# in ``x`` and ``y`` dimensions.

# %%
# The loaded dataset ``ds`` contains two data arrays:
# ``position`` and ``confidence``.
# To compute displacement, velocity and acceleration, we will need the
# ``position`` one:
position = ds.position

# Visualise the data
# ---------------------------
# First, let's visualise the trajectories of the mice in the XY plane,
# colouring them by individual.

# follows the convention for SLEAP and most image processing tools.

# %%
# We can also color the data points based on their timestamps:

# These plots show that for this snippet of the data,
# two of the mice (``AEON3B_NTP`` and ``AEON3B_TP1``)
# moved around the circle in clockwise direction, and
# the third mouse (``AEON3B_TP2``) followed an anti-clockwise direction.

# %%
# We can also easily plot the components of the position vector against time
# using ``xarray``'s built-in plotting methods. We use
# :meth:`xarray.DataArray.squeeze` to
# remove the dimension of length 1 from the data (the ``keypoints`` dimension).
position.squeeze().plot.line(x="time", row="individuals", aspect=2, size=2.5)

# %%
# If we use ``xarray``'s plotting function, the axes units are automatically
# taken from the data array. In our case, ``time`` is expressed in seconds,
# and the ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates of the ``position`` are in pixels.

# %%
# Compute displacement
# ---------------------
# The :mod:`movement.kinematics` module provides functions to compute
# various kinematic quantities,
# such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
# We can start off by computing the distance travelled by the mice along
# their trajectories:

import movement.kinematics as kin

displacement = kin.compute_displacement(position)

# %%
# The :func:`movement.kinematics.compute_displacement`
# function will return a data array equivalent to the ``position`` one,
# but holding displacement data along the ``space`` axis, rather than
# position data.
#
# The ``displacement`` data array holds, for a given individual and keypoint
# at timestep ``t``, the vector that goes from its previous position at time
# ``t-1`` to its current position at time ``t``.

# %%
# And what happens at ``t=0``, since there is no previous timestep?
# We define the displacement vector at time ``t=0`` to be the zero vector.
# This way the shape of the ``displacement`` data array is the
# same as the  ``position`` array:
print(f"Shape of position: {position.shape}")
print(f"Shape of displacement: {displacement.shape}")

# %%
# We can visualise these displacement vectors with a quiver plot. In this case
# we focus on the mouse ``AEON3B_TP2``:
mouse_name = "AEON3B_TP2"

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()

# plot position data
sc = ax.scatter(
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),
    s=15,
    c=position.time,
    cmap="viridis",
)

# plot displacement vectors: at t, vector from t-1 to t
ax.quiver(
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),
    displacement.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),
    displacement.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),
    angles="xy",
    scale=1,
    scale_units="xy",
    headwidth=7,
    headlength=9,
    headaxislength=9,
)

ax.axis("equal")
ax.set_xlim(450, 575)
ax.set_ylim(950, 1075)
ax.set_xlabel("x (pixels)")
ax.set_ylabel("y (pixels)")
ax.set_title(f"Zoomed in trajectory of {mouse_name}")

fig.colorbar(sc, ax=ax, label="time (s)")

# %%
# Notice that this figure is not very useful as a visual check:
# we can see that there are vectors defined for each point in
# the trajectory, but we have no easy way to verify they are indeed
# the displacement vectors from ``t-1`` to ``t``.

# %%
# If instead we plot
# the opposite of the displacement vector, we will see that at every time
# ``t``, the vectors point to the position at ``t-1``.
# Remember that the displacement vector is defined as the vector at
# time ``t``, that goes from the previous position ``t-1`` to the
# current position at ``t``. Therefore, the opposite vector will point
# from the position point at ``t``, to the position point at ``t-1``.

# %%
# We can easily do this by flipping the sign of the displacement vector in
# the plot above:
mouse_name = "AEON3B_TP2"

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()

# plot position data
sc = ax.scatter(
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),
    s=15,
    c=position.time,
    cmap="viridis",
)

# plot displacement vectors: at t, vector from t-1 to t
ax.quiver(
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),
    -displacement.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),  # flipped sign
    -displacement.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),  # flipped sign
    angles="xy",
    scale=1,
    scale_units="xy",

ax.invert_yaxis()
fig.colorbar(sc, ax=ax, label="time (s)")


# %%
# Now we can visually verify that indeed the displacement vector
# connects the previous and current positions as expected.

# %%
# With the displacement data we can compute the distance travelled by the
# mouse along its trajectory.

# length of each displacement vector
displacement_vectors_lengths = compute_norm(
    displacement.sel(individuals=mouse_name)
)

# sum the lengths of all displacement vectors (in pixels)

)

# %%
# Compute velocity
# ----------------
# We can easily compute the velocity vectors for all individuals in our data
# array:
velocity = kin.compute_velocity(position)

# %%
# The :func:`movement.kinematics.compute_velocity`
# function will return a data array equivalent to
# the ``position`` one, but holding velocity data along the ``space`` axis,
# rather than position data. Notice how ``xarray`` nicely deals with the
# different individuals and spatial dimensions for us! âœ¨

# %%
# We can plot the components of the velocity vector against time
# using ``xarray``'s built-in plotting methods. We use
# :meth:`xarray.DataArray.squeeze` to
# remove the dimension of length 1 from the data (the ``keypoints`` dimension).

velocity.squeeze().plot.line(x="time", row="individuals", aspect=2, size=2.5)
plt.gcf().show()

# %%
# The components of the velocity vector seem noisier than the components of
# the position vector.
# This is expected, since we are deriving the velocity using differences in
# position (which is somewhat noisy), over small stepsizes.
# More specifically, we use numpy's gradient implementation, which
# uses second order central differences.

# %%
# We can also visualise the speed, as the magnitude (norm)
# of the velocity vector:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, sharey=True)
for mouse_name, ax in zip(velocity.individuals.values, axes, strict=False):
    # compute the magnitude of the velocity vector for one mouse
    speed_one_mouse = compute_norm(velocity.sel(individuals=mouse_name))
    # plot speed against time
    ax.plot(speed_one_mouse)
    ax.set_title(mouse_name)
    ax.set_xlabel("time (s)")
    ax.set_ylabel("speed (px/s)")
fig.tight_layout()

# %%
# To visualise the direction of the velocity vector at each timestep, we can
# use a quiver plot:
mouse_name = "AEON3B_TP2"
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()
# plot trajectory (position data)
sc = ax.scatter(
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="y"),
    s=15,

# plot velocity vectors
ax.quiver(
    position.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space="x"),

# Here we scaled the length of vectors to half of their actual value
# (``scale=2``) for easier visualisation.

# %%
# Compute acceleration
# ---------------------
# Let's now compute the acceleration for all individuals in our data
# array:
accel = kin.compute_acceleration(position)

# %%
# and plot of the components of the acceleration vector ``ax``, ``ay`` per
# individual:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, sharey=True)

    ax.set_ylabel("speed (px/s**2)")
    ax.legend(loc="center right", bbox_to_anchor=(1.07, 1.07))
fig.tight_layout()

# %%
# We can also compute and visualise the magnitude (norm) of the
