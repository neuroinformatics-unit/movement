# ------------------------
# First, we load an example dataset. In this case, we select the

# We can see in the printed description of the dataset ``ds`` that
# the data was acquired at 50 fps, and the time axis is expressed in seconds.
# It includes data for three individuals(``AEON3B_NTP``, ``AEON3B_TP1``,
# and ``AEON3B_TP2``), and only one keypoint called ``centroid`` was tracked
# in ``x`` and ``y`` dimensions.

# %%
# The loaded dataset ``ds`` contains two data arrays:
# ``position`` and ``confidence``.
# To compute displacement, velocity and acceleration, we will need the

# Visualise the data
# ---------------------------
# First, let's visualise the trajectories of the mice in the XY plane,
# colouring them by individual.

# follows the convention for SLEAP and most image processing tools.

# %%
# We can also color the data points based on their timestamps:

# two of the mice (``AEON3B_NTP`` and ``AEON3B_TP1``)
# moved around the circle in clockwise direction, and
# the third mouse (``AEON3B_TP2``) followed an anti-clockwise direction.

# %%
# We can also easily plot the components of the position vector against time
# using ``xarray``'s built-in plotting methods. We use ``squeeze()`` to
# remove the dimension of length 1 from the data (the keypoints dimension).
position.squeeze().plot.line(x="time", row="individuals", aspect=2, size=2.5)

# %%
# If we use ``xarray``'s plotting function, the axes units are automatically
# taken from the data array. In our case, ``time`` is expressed in seconds,
# and the ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates of the ``position`` are in pixels.

# %%
# Compute displacement
# ---------------------
# We can start off by computing the distance travelled by the mice along
# their trajectories.
# For this, we can use the ``displacement`` method of the ``move`` accessor.
displacement = ds.move.displacement

# %%
# This method will return a data array equivalent to the ``position`` one,
# but holding displacement data along the ``space`` axis, rather than
# position data.

# %%
# Notice that we could also compute the displacement (and all the other
# kinematic variables) using the kinematics module:

# %%
import movement.analysis.kinematics as kin

displacement_kin = kin.compute_displacement(position)

# %%
# However, we encourage our users to familiarise themselves with the ``move``
# accessor, since it has a very interesting advantage: if we use
# ``ds.move.displacement`` to compute the displacement data array, it
# will be automatically added to the ``ds`` dataset. This is very
# convenient for later analyses!
# See further details in :ref:`target-access-kinematics`.

# %%
# The ``displacement`` data array holds, for a given individual and keypoint
# at timestep ``t``, the vector that goes from its previous position at time
# ``t-1`` to its current position at time ``t``.

# %%
# And what happens at ``t=0``, since there is no previous timestep?
# We define the displacement vector at time ``t=0`` to be the zero vector.
# This way the shape of the ``displacement`` data array is the
# same as the  ``position`` array:
print(f"Shape of position: {position.shape}")
print(f"Shape of displacement: {displacement.shape}")

# %%
# We can visualise these displacement vectors with a quiver plot. In this case
# we focus on the mouse ``AEON3B_TP2``:
mouse_name = "AEON3B_TP2"

# %%
# Notice that this figure is not very useful as a visual check:
# we can see that there are vectors defined for each point in
# the trajectory, but we have no easy way to verify they are indeed
# the displacement vectors from ``t-1`` to ``t``.

# %%
# If instead we plot
# the opposite of the displacement vector, we will see that at every time
# ``t``, the vectors point to the position at ``t-1``.
# Remember that the displacement vector is defined as the vector at
# time ``t``, that goes from the previous position ``t-1`` to the
# current position at ``t``. Therefore, the opposite vector will point
# from the position point at ``t``, to the position point at ``t-1``.

# %%
# We can easily do this by flipping the sign of the displacement vector in
# the plot above:
mouse_name = "AEON3B_TP2"

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()

# plot position data

# connects the previous and current positions as expected.

# With the displacement data we can compute the distance travelled by the

# length of each displacement vector

# %%
# Compute velocity
# ----------------
# We can easily compute the velocity vectors for all individuals in our data
# array:
velocity = ds.move.velocity

# %%
# The ``velocity`` method will return a data array equivalent to the
# ``position`` one, but holding velocity data along the ``space`` axis, rather
# than position data. Notice how ``xarray`` nicely deals with the different
# individuals and spatial dimensions for us! âœ¨

# %%
# We can plot the components of the velocity vector against time
# using ``xarray``'s built-in plotting methods. We use ``squeeze()`` to
# remove the dimension of length 1 from the data (the keypoints dimension).

velocity.squeeze().plot.line(x="time", row="individuals", aspect=2, size=2.5)
plt.gcf().show()

# %%
# The components of the velocity vector seem noisier than the components of
# the position vector.
# This is expected, since we are deriving the velocity using differences in
# position (which is somewhat noisy), over small stepsizes.
# More specifically, we use numpy's gradient implementation, which
# uses second order central differences.

# %%
# We can also visualise the speed, as the norm of the velocity vector:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, sharey=True)
for mouse_name, ax in zip(velocity.individuals.values, axes):
    # compute the norm of the velocity vector for one mouse
    speed_one_mouse = np.linalg.norm(
        velocity.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space=["x", "y"]).squeeze(),
        axis=1,

    ax.set_xlabel("time (s)")
    ax.set_ylabel("speed (px/s)")

# plot trajectory (position data)
sc = ax.scatter(

# Here we scaled the length of vectors to half of their actual value
# (``scale=2``) for easier visualisation.

# %%
# Compute acceleration
# ---------------------
# We can compute the acceleration of the data with an equivalent method:
accel = ds.move.acceleration

# %%
# and plot of the components of the acceleration vector ``ax``, ``ay`` per
# individual:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, sharey=True)

        accel.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space=["y"]).squeeze(),

    ax.set_xlabel("time (s)")
    ax.set_ylabel("speed (px/s**2)")
    ax.legend(loc="center right", bbox_to_anchor=(1.07, 1.07))
fig.tight_layout()

# %%
# The norm of the acceleration vector is the magnitude of the
# acceleration.
# We can also represent this for each individual.
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, sharey=True)
for mouse_name, ax in zip(accel.individuals.values, axes):
    # compute norm of the acceleration vector for one mouse
    accel_one_mouse = np.linalg.norm(
        accel.sel(individuals=mouse_name, space=["x", "y"]).squeeze(),

# Accessing pre-computed kinematic variables
# ------------------------------------------
# Once each kinematic variable has been computed via the ``move`` accessor,
# (e.g. by calling ``ds.move.velocity``), the resulting data array will
# also be available as a dataset property, (e.g. as ``ds.velocity``).
# Since we've already computed ``displacement``, ``velocity`` and
# ``acceleration`` above, they should be listed among the data arrays
# contained in the dataset:

# ``displacement``, ``velocity`` and ``acceleration``.
