# Load a sample dataset

ds = sample_data.fetch_dataset("DLC_single-wasp.predictions.h5")
print(ds)

# %%
# We see that the dataset contains the 2D pose tracks and confidence scores
# for a single wasp, generated with DeepLabCut. The wasp is tracked at two
# keypoints: "head" and "stinger" in a video that was recorded at 40 fps and
# lasts for approximately 27 seconds.

# %%
# Visualise the pose tracks
# -------------------------
# Since the data contains only a single wasp, we use
# :meth:`xarray.DataArray.squeeze` to remove
# the dimension of length 1 from the data (the ``individuals`` dimension).

ds.position.squeeze().plot.line(
    x="time", row="keypoints", hue="space", aspect=2, size=2.5
)

# %%
# We can see that the pose tracks contain some implausible "jumps", such
# as the big shift in the final second, and the "spikes" of the stinger
# near the 14th second. Perhaps we can get rid of those based on the model's
# reported confidence scores?

# %%
# Visualise confidence scores
# ---------------------------
# The confidence scores are stored in the ``confidence`` data variable.
# Since the predicted poses in this example have been generated by DeepLabCut,
# the confidence scores should be likelihood values between 0 and 1.
# That said, confidence scores are not standardised across pose
# estimation frameworks, and their ranges can vary. Therefore,
# it's always a good idea to inspect the actual confidence values in the data.
#
# Let's first look at a histogram of the confidence scores. As before, we use
# :meth:`xarray.DataArray.squeeze` to remove the ``individuals`` dimension
# from the data.

ds.confidence.squeeze().plot.hist(bins=20)

# %%
# Based on the above histogram, we can confirm that the confidence scores
# indeed range between 0 and 1, with most values closer to 1. Now let's see how
# they evolve over time.

ds.confidence.squeeze().plot.line(
    x="time", row="keypoints", aspect=2, size=2.5
)

# %%
# Encouragingly, some of the drops in confidence scores do seem to correspond
# to the implausible jumps and spikes we had seen in the position.
# We can use that to our advantage, by leveraging functions from the
# :mod:`movement.filtering` module.

# %%
# Filter out points with low confidence
# -------------------------------------
# Using :func:`movement.filtering.filter_by_confidence`,
# we can filter out points with confidence scores below a certain threshold.
# This function takes ``position`` and ``confidence`` as required arguments,
# and accepts an optional ``threshold`` parameter,
# which defaults to ``threshold=0.6`` unless specified otherwise.
# Setting ``print_report=True``, will make the function print a report
# on the number of NaN values before and after the filtering operation.
# This is ``False`` by default, but can be useful for understanding
# and debugging the impact of filtering on the data.
#
# We will use :meth:`xarray.Dataset.update` to update ``ds`` in-place
# with the filtered ``position``.

ds.update(
    {
        "position": filter_by_confidence(
            ds.position, ds.confidence, print_report=True
        )
    }
)

# %%
# We can see that the filtering operation has introduced NaN values in the
# ``position`` data variable. Let's visualise the filtered data.

ds.position.squeeze().plot.line(
    x="time", row="keypoints", hue="space", aspect=2, size=2.5
)

# %%
# Here we can see that gaps (consecutive NaNs) have appeared in the
# pose tracks, some of which are over the implausible jumps and spikes we had
# seen earlier. Moreover, most gaps seem to be brief,
# lasting < 1 second (or 40 frames).

# %%
# Interpolate over missing values
# -------------------------------
# Using  :func:`movement.filtering.interpolate_over_time`, we can
# interpolate over gaps we've introduced in the pose tracks.
# Here we use the default linear interpolation method (``method="linear"``)
# and interpolate over gaps of 40 frames or less (``max_gap=40``).
# The default ``max_gap=None`` would interpolate over all gaps, regardless of
# their length, but this should be used with caution as it can introduce
# spurious data. The ``print_report`` argument acts as described above.

ds.update(
    {
        "position": interpolate_over_time(
            ds.position, max_gap=40, print_report=True
        )
    }
)

# %%
# We see that most, but not all, NaN values have disappeared, meaning that
# most gaps were indeed shorter than 40 frames.
# Let's visualise the interpolated pose tracks.

ds.position.squeeze().plot.line(
    x="time", row="keypoints", hue="space", aspect=2, size=2.5
)

# %%
# .. note::
#   By default, interpolation does not apply to gaps at either end of the time
#   series. In our case, the last few frames removed by filtering were not
#   replaced by interpolation. Passing ``fill_value="extrapolate"`` to the
#   :func:`interpolate_over_time()<movement.filtering.interpolate_over_time>`
#   function would extrapolate the data to also fill the gaps at either end.
#
#   In general, you may pass any keyword arguments that are acceptable as
#   ``**kwargs`` by :meth:`xarray.DataArray.interpolate_na`, which in turn
#   passes them to its underlying interpolation methods.

# %%
# Log of processing steps
# -----------------------
# So, far we've processed the pose tracks first by filtering out points with
# low confidence scores, and then by interpolating over missing values.
# The order of these operations and the parameters with which they were
# performed are saved in the ``log`` attribute of the ``position`` data array.
# This is useful for keeping track of the processing steps that have been
# applied to the data. Let's inspect the log entries.

for log_entry in ds.position.log:
    print(log_entry)

# %%
# Filtering multiple data variables
# ---------------------------------
# We can also apply the same filtering operation to
# multiple data variables in ``ds`` at the same time.
#
# For instance, to filter both ``position`` and ``velocity`` data variables
# in ``ds``, based on the confidence scores, we can specify a dictionary
# with the data variable names as keys and the corresponding filtered
# DataArrays as values. Then we can once again use
# :meth:`xarray.Dataset.update`  to update ``ds`` in-place
# with the filtered data variables.

# Add velocity data variable to the dataset
ds["velocity"] = compute_velocity(ds.position)

# Create a dictionary mapping data variable names to filtered DataArrays
# We disable report printing for brevity
update_dict = {
    var: filter_by_confidence(ds[var], ds.confidence)
    for var in ["position", "velocity"]
}

# Use the dictionary to update the dataset in-place
ds.update(update_dict)
