from movement import sample_data
from movement.filtering import filter_by_confidence, interpolate_over_time

# %%
# Load a sample dataset
# ---------------------

ds = sample_data.fetch_sample_data("DLC_single-wasp.predictions.h5")
print(ds)

# %%
# We can see that this dataset contains the 2D pose tracks and confidence
# scores for a single wasp, generated with DeepLabCut. There are 2 keypoints:
# "head" and "stinger".

# %%
# Visualise the pose tracks
# -------------------------

position = ds.position.sel(individuals="individual_0")
position.plot.line(x="time", row="keypoints", hue="space", aspect=2, size=2.5)

# %%
# We can see that the pose tracks contain some implausible "jumps", such
# as the big shift in the final second, and the "spikes" of the stinger
# near the 14th second. Perhaps we can get rid of those based on the model's
# reported confidence scores?

# %%
# Visualise confidence scores
# ---------------------------
# The confidence scores are stored in the ``confidence`` data variable.
# Since the predicted poses in this example have been generated by DeepLabCut,
# the confidence scores should be likelihood values between 0 and 1.
# That said, confidence scores are not standardised across pose
# estimation frameworks, and their ranges can vary. Therefore,
# it's always a good idea to inspect the actual confidence values in the data.
#
# Let's first look at a histogram of the confidence scores.
ds.confidence.plot.hist(bins=20)

# %%
# Based on the above histogram, we can confirm that the confidence scores
# indeed range between 0 and 1, with most values closer to 1. Now let's see how
# they evolve over time.

confidence = ds.confidence.sel(individuals="individual_0")
confidence.plot.line(x="time", row="keypoints", aspect=2, size=2.5)

# %%
# Encouragingly, some of the drops in confidence scores do seem to correspond
# to the implausible jumps and spikes we had seen in the position.
# We can use that to our advantage.


# %%
# Filter out points with low confidence
# -------------------------------------
# We can filter out points with confidence scores below a certain threshold.
# Here, we use ``threshold=0.6``. Points in the ``position`` data variable
# with confidence scores below this threshold will be converted to NaN.
# The ``print_report`` argument, which is True by default, reports the number
# of NaN values in the dataset before and after the filtering operation.

ds_filtered = filter_by_confidence(ds, threshold=0.6, print_report=True)

# %%
# We can see that the filtering operation has introduced NaN values in the
# ``position`` data variable. Let's visualise the filtered data.

position_filtered = ds_filtered.position.sel(individuals="individual_0")
position_filtered.plot.line(
    x="time", row="keypoints", hue="space", aspect=2, size=2.5
)

# %%
# Here we can see that gaps have appeared in the pose tracks, some of which
# are over the implausible jumps and spikes we had seen earlier. Moreover,
# most gaps seem to be brief, lasting < 1 second.

# %%
# Interpolate over missing values
# -------------------------------
# We can interpolate over the gaps we've introduced in the pose tracks.
# Here we use the default linear interpolation method and ``max_gap=1``,
# meaning that we will only interpolate over gaps of 1 second or shorter.
# Setting ``max_gap=None`` would interpolate over all gaps, regardless of
# their length, which should be used with caution as it can introduce
# spurious data. The ``print_report`` argument acts as described above.

ds_interpolated = interpolate_over_time(
    ds_filtered, method="linear", max_gap=1, print_report=True
)

# %%
# We see that all NaN values have disappeared, meaning that all gaps were
# indeed shorter than 1 second. Let's visualise the interpolated pose tracks

position_interpolated = ds_interpolated.position.sel(
    individuals="individual_0"
)
position_interpolated.plot.line(
    x="time", row="keypoints", hue="space", aspect=2, size=2.5
)

# %%
# Log of processing steps
# -----------------------
# So, far we've processed the pose tracks first by filtering out points with
# low confidence scores, and then by interpolating over missing values.
# The order of these operations and the parameters with which they were
# performed are saved in the ``log`` attribute of the dataset.
# This is useful for keeping track of the processing steps that have been
# applied to the data.
