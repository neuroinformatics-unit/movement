# We will be using the :mod:`movement.utils.broadcasting` module to
# turn our one-dimensional functions into functions that work across
# entire ``DataArray`` objects.

# Load Sample Dataset

# Motivation
# ----------
# Suppose that, during our experiment, we have a region of the enclosure that
# has a slightly wet floor, making it slippery. The individuals must cross this
# region in order to reach some kind of reward on the other side of the
# enclosure.
# We know that the "slippery region" of our enclosure is approximately
# rectangular in shape, and has its opposite corners at (400, 0) and
# (600, 2000), where the coordinates are given in pixels.
# We could then write a function that determines if a given (x, y) position was
# inside this "slippery region".

    """Return True if xy_position is in the slippery region.

    Return False otherwise.

# Data Generalisation Issues
# --------------------------
# The shape of the resulting ``DataArray`` is the same as our original
# ``DataArray``, but without the ``"space"`` dimension.
# Indeed, we have essentially collapsed the ``"space"`` dimension, since our
# ``in_slippery_region`` function takes in a 1D data slice (the x, y positions
# of a single individual's centroid at a given point in time) and returns a
# scalar value (True/False).
# However, the fact that we have to construct a new ``DataArray`` after running
# our function over all space slices in our ``DataArray`` is not scalable - our
# ``for`` loop approach relied on knowing how many dimensions our data had (and
# the size of those dimensions). We don't have a guarantee that the next
# ``DataArray`` that comes in will have the same structure.

# %%
# Making our Function Broadcastable
# ---------------------------------
# To combat this problem, we can make the observation that given any
# ``DataArray``, we always want to broadcast our ``in_slippery_region``
# function
# along the ``"space"`` dimension. By "broadcast", we mean that we always want
# to run our function for each 1D-slice in the ``"space"`` dimension, since
# these are the (x, y) coordinates. As such, we can decorate our function with
# the ``make_broadcastable`` decorator:


@make_broadcastable()
def in_slippery_region_broadcastable(xy_position) -> float:
    return in_slippery_region(xy_position=xy_position)


# %%
# Note that when writing your own methods, there is no need to have both
# ``in_slippery_region`` and ``in_slippery_region_broadcastable``, simply apply
# the ``make_broadcastable`` decorator to ``in_slippery_region`` directly.
# We've made two separate functions here to illustrate what's going on.

# %%
# ``in_slippery_region_broadcastable`` is usable in exactly the same ways as
# ``in_slippery_region`` was:

for point in [(0, 100), (450, 700), (550, 1500), (601, 500)]:
    print(
        f"{point} is in slippery region: "
        f"{in_slippery_region_broadcastable(point)}"
    )


# %%
# However, ``in_slippery_region_broadcastable`` also takes a ``DataArray`` as
# the first (``xy_position``) argument, and an extra keyword argument
# ``broadcast_dimension``. These arguments let us broadcast across the given
# dimension of the input ``DataArray``, treating each 1D-slice as a separate
# input to ``in_slippery_region``.

in_slippery_region_broadcasting = in_slippery_region_broadcastable(
    positions,  # Now a DataArray input
    broadcast_dimension="space",
)

print("DataArray output using broadcasting: ")
in_slippery_region_broadcasting

# %%
# Calling ``in_slippery_region_broadcastable`` in this way gives us a
# ``DataArray`` output - and one that retains any information that was in our
# original ``DataArray`` to boot! The result is exactly the same as what we got
# from using our ``for`` loop, and then adding the extra information to the
# result.

# Throws an AssertionError if the two inputs are not the same
xr.testing.assert_equal(
    was_in_slippery_region, in_slippery_region_broadcasting
)

# %%
# But importantly, ``in_slippery_region_broadcastable`` also works on
# ``DataArrays`` with different dimensions.
# For example, we could have pre-selected one of our individuals beforehand.
i_id = "AEON3B_NTP"
individual_0 = positions.sel(individuals=i_id)

individual_0_in_slippery_region = in_slippery_region_broadcastable(
    individual_0,
    broadcast_dimension="space",
)

print(
    "We get a 3D DataArray output from our 4D input, "
    "again with the 'space' dimension that we broadcast along collapsed:"
)
individual_0_in_slippery_region

# %%
# Additional Function Arguments
# -----------------------------
# So far our ``in_slippery_region`` method only takes a single argument,
# the ``xy_position`` itself. However in follow-up experiments, we might move
# the slippery region in the enclosure, and so adapt our existing function to
# make it more general.
# It will now allow someone to input a custom rectangular region, by specifying
# the minimum and maximum ``(x, y)`` coordinates of the rectangle, rather than
# relying on fixed values inside the function.
# The default region will be the rectangle from our first experiment, and we
# still want to be able to broadcast this function.
# And so we write a more general function, as below.


@make_broadcastable()
def in_slippery_region_general(
    xy_position, xy_min=(400.0, 0.0), xy_max=(600.0, 2000.0)
) -> bool:
    """Return True if xy_position is in the slippery region.

    Return False otherwise.
    xy_position has 2 elements, the (x, y) coordinates respectively.
    """
    x_min, y_min = xy_min
    x_max, y_max = xy_max
    is_within_bounds_x = x_min <= xy_position[0] <= x_max
    is_within_bounds_y = y_min <= xy_position[1] <= y_max
    return is_within_bounds_x and is_within_bounds_y


# (0.5, 0.5) is in the unit square whose bottom left corner is at the origin
print(in_slippery_region_general((0.5, 0.5), (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)))
# But (0.5,0.5) is not in a unit square whose bottom left corner is at (1,1)
print(in_slippery_region_general((0.5, 0.5), (1.0, 1.0), (2.0, 2.0)))

# %%
# We will find that ``make_broadcastable`` retains the additional arguments to
# the function we define, however the ``xy_position`` argument has to be the
# first argument to the function, that appears in the ``def`` statement.

# Default arguments should give us the same results as before
xr.testing.assert_equal(
    was_in_slippery_region, in_slippery_region_general(positions)

# But we can also provide the optional arguments in the same way as with the
# un-decorated function.

# %%
# Only Broadcast Along Select Dimensions
# --------------------------------------
# The ``make_broadcastable`` decorator has some flexibility with its input
# arguments, to help you avoid unintentional behaviour. You may have noticed,
# for example, that there is nothing stopping someone who wants to use your
# analysis code from trying to broadcast along the wrong dimension.

# There is no error thrown because functionally, this is a valid operation.
# The time slices of our data were 1D, so we can run ``in_slippery_region`` on
# them. But each slice isn't a position, it's an array of one spatial
# coordinate (EG x) for each keypoint, each individual, at every time! So from
# an analysis standpoint, doing this doesn't make sense and isn't how we intend
# our function to be used.
