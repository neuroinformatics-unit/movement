# Load sample dataset
# -------------------
# In this tutorial, we will use a sample dataset with a single individual

# The loaded dataset ``ds`` contains two data arrays:``position`` and
# ``confidence``. In this tutorial, we will only use the ``position`` data
# array. We use the ``squeeze()`` method to remove
# the redundant ``individuals`` dimension, as there is only one individual
# in this dataset.

# %%
# Visualise the head trajectory
# -----------------------------
# We can start by visualising the head trajectory, taking the midpoint
# between the ears as an estimate for the head centre.
# We will overlay that on a single video frame that comes
# as part of the sample dataset.
#
# The :func:`plot_trajectory()<movement.plots.trajectory.plot_trajectory>`
# function can help you visualise the trajectory of any keypoint in the data.
# Passing a list of keypoints, in this case ``["left_ear", "right_ear"]``,
# will plot the centroid (midpoint) of the selected keypoints.
# By default, the first individual in the dataset is shown.

# Compute the head vector as the difference vector between the snout position
# and the head-centre position.

# .. admonition:: Vector subtraction
#   :class: note
#
#   Note that any position data point can be seen as a point :math:`U` in the
#   2D plane, or as a 2D vector :math:`\vec{u}` that goes from the image
#   coordinate system origin (by default, the centre of the top-left pixel)
#   to the point :math:`U` (see left subplot).
#
#   The vector that goes from point :math:`U` to point :math:`V` can be
#   computed as the difference :math:`\vec{v} - \vec{u}`
#   (see right subplot).

# Head-to-snout vector in polar coordinates
# -----------------------------------------
# Now that we have the head-to-snout vector, we can compute its
# angle in 2D space. A convenient way to achieve that is to convert the
# vector from cartesian to polar coordinates using the
# :func:`cart2pol()<movement.utils.vector.cart2pol>` function.

head_to_snout_polar = cart2pol(head_to_snout)

print(head_to_snout_polar)

# %%
# Notice how the resulting array has a ``space_pol`` dimension with two
# coordinates: ``rho`` and ``phi``. These are the polar coordinates of the
# head vector.
#
# .. admonition:: Polar coordinates
#   :class: note
#
#   The coordinate ``rho`` is the norm (i.e., magnitude, length) of the vector.
#   In our case, the distance from the midpoint between the ears to the snout.
#
#   The coordinate ``phi`` is the shortest angle (in radians) between the
#   positive x-axis and the  vector, and ranges from :math:`-\pi` to
#   :math:`\pi` (following the
#   `atan2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2>`_ convention).
#   The ``phi`` angle is positive if the rotation
#   from the positive x-axis to the vector is in the same direction as
#   the rotation from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis.
#   In the default image coordinate system, this means  ``phi`` will be
#   positive if the rotation is clockwise, and negative if the rotation
#   is anti-clockwise.
#
#   .. image:: ../_static/Cartesian-vs-Polar.png
#     :width: 600
#     :alt: Schematic comparing cartesian and polar coordinates

# %%
# ``movement`` also provides a ``pol2cart`` function to transform
# data in polar coordinates to cartesian.
# Note that the resulting ``head_to_snout_cart`` array has a ``space``
# dimension with two coordinates: ``x`` and ``y``.

head_to_snout_cart = pol2cart(head_to_snout_polar)
print(head_to_snout_cart)

# %%
# Compute the "forward" vector
# ----------------------------
# We can also estimate the head direction using the
# :func:`compute_forward_vector()<movement.kinematics.compute_forward_vector>`
# function, which takes a different approach to the one we used above:
# it accepts a pair of bilaterally symmetric keypoints and
# computes the vector that originates at the midpoint between the keypoints
# and is perpendicular to the line connecting them.
#
# Here we will use the two ears to find the head direction vector.
# We may prefer this method if we expect the snout detection to be
# unreliable (e.g., because it's often occluded in a top-down camera view).

forward_vector = compute_forward_vector(
    position,
    left_keypoint="left_ear",
    right_keypoint="right_ear",
    camera_view="top_down",
)
print(forward_vector)

# %%
# .. admonition:: Why do we need to specify the camera view?
#   :class: note
#
#   You can think about it in this way: in order to uniquely determine which
#   way is forward for an animal, we need to know the orientation of the other
#   two body axes: left-right and up-down. The left-right axis is specified
#   by the left and right keypoints passed to the function, while we use the
#   ``camera_view`` parameter to determine the upward direction (see image).
#   The default view is ``"top_down"``, but it can also be ``"bottom_up"``.
#   Other camera views are not supported at the moment.
#
#   .. image:: ../_static/Forward-Vector.png
#     :width: 600
#     :alt: Schematic showing forward vector in top-down and bottom-up views


# %%
# You can use ``compute_forward_vector`` to compute the perpendicular
# vector to any line connecting two bilaterally symmetric keypoints.
# For example, you could estimate the forward direction for the pelvis given
# two keypoints at the hips.
#
# Specifically for the head direction vector, you may also use the alias
# :func:`compute_head_direction_vector()\
# <movement.kinematics.compute_head_direction_vector>`,
# which makes the intent of the function clearer.

# %%
# Compute head direction angle
# ----------------------------
# We may want to explicitly compute the orientation of the animal's head
# as an angle, rather than as a vector.
# We can compute this angle from the forward vector as
# we did with the head-to-snout vector, i.e., by converting the vector to
# polar coordinates and extracting the ``phi`` coordinate. However, it's
# more convenient to use the :func:`compute_forward_vector_angle()\
# <movement.kinematics.compute_forward_vector_angle>` function, which
# by default would return the same ``phi`` angle.

forward_vector_angle = compute_forward_vector_angle(
    position,
    left_keypoint="left_ear",
    right_keypoint="right_ear",
    # Optional parameters:
    reference_vector=(1, 0),  # positive x-axis
    camera_view="top_down",
    in_degrees=False,  # set to True for degrees
)
print(forward_vector_angle)

# %%
# The resulting ``forward_vector_angle`` array contains the head direction
# angle in radians, with respect to the positive x-axis. This means that
# the angle is zero when the head vector is pointing to the right of the frame.
# We could have also used an alternative reference vector, such as the
# negative y-axis (pointing to the top edge of the frame) by setting
# ``reference_vector=(0, -1)``.

# %%
# Visualise head direction angles
# -------------------------------
# We can compare the head direction angles computed from the two methods,
# i.e. the polar angle ``phi`` of the head-to-snout vector and the polar angle
# of the forward vector, by plotting their histograms in polar coordinates.
# First, let's define a custom plotting function that will help us with this.
