"""Compute path-level metrics such as path length and straightness.

By 'path' we refer to the spatial trajectory of an individual between two
time points. While these metrics can be computed based on any set of
keypoints, they are most meaningful when applied to a single keypoint
representing the individual's overall position (e.g., centroid).

    r"""Compute the length of a path travelled between two time points.

    The path length is defined as the sum of the norms (magnitudes) of the
    displacement vectors between two time points ``start`` and ``stop``,
    which should be provided in the time units of the data array.
    If not specified, the minimum and maximum time coordinates of the data
    array are used as start and stop times, respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : xarray.DataArray
        The input data containing position information, with ``time``
        and ``space`` (in Cartesian coordinates) as required dimensions.
    start : float, optional
        The start time of the path. If None (default),
        the minimum time coordinate in the data is used.
    stop : float, optional
        The end time of the path. If None (default),
        the maximum time coordinate in the data is used.
    nan_policy : Literal["ffill", "scale"], optional
        Policy to handle NaN (missing) values. Can be one of the ``"ffill"``
        or ``"scale"``. Defaults to ``"ffill"`` (forward fill).
        See Notes for more details on the two policies.
    nan_warn_threshold : float, optional
        If any point track in the data has at least (:math:`\ge`)
        this proportion of values missing, a warning will be emitted.
        Defaults to 0.2 (20%).

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        An xarray DataArray containing the computed path length,
        with dimensions matching those of the input data,
        except ``time`` and ``space`` are removed.

    Notes
    -----
    Choosing ``nan_policy="ffill"`` will use :meth:`xarray.DataArray.ffill`
    to forward-fill missing segments (NaN values) across time.
    This equates to assuming that a track remains stationary for
    the duration of the missing segment and then instantaneously moves to
    the next valid position, following a straight line. This approach tends
    to underestimate the path length, and the error increases with the number
    of missing values.

    Choosing ``nan_policy="scale"`` will adjust the path length based on the
    the proportion of valid segments per point track. For example, if only
    80% of segments are present, the path length will be computed based on
    these and the result will be divided by 0.8. This approach assumes
    that motion dynamics are similar across observed and missing time
    segments, which may not accurately reflect actual conditions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from movement.kinematics import compute_path_length

    Compute the path length from the centroid trajectory of a poses
    dataset ``ds``:

    >>> centroid = ds.position.mean(dim="keypoints")
    >>> length = compute_path_length(centroid)

    Compute path length over a specific time window:

    >>> length = compute_path_length(centroid, start=0, stop=100)

    Use the scale policy to handle missing values:

    >>> length = compute_path_length(centroid, nan_policy="scale")

    r"""Compute the straightness index of a path :math:`(D/L)`.

    The straightness index is the ratio of the Euclidean distance :math:`D`
    between the first and last valid positions of a trajectory to the
    total path length :math:`L`. Values range from 0 to 1, where 1
    indicates a perfectly straight path and 0 indicates the animal
    returned to its starting point. Returns NaN if the path length is zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : xarray.DataArray
        The input data containing position information, with ``time``
        and ``space`` (in Cartesian coordinates) as required dimensions.
    start : float, optional
        The start time of the path. If None (default),
        the minimum time coordinate in the data is used.
    stop : float, optional
        The end time of the path. If None (default),
        the maximum time coordinate in the data is used.
    nan_policy : Literal["ffill", "scale"], optional
        Policy to handle NaN (missing) values for the path length computation.
        Can be one of ``"ffill"`` or ``"scale"``. Defaults to ``"ffill"``
        (forward fill). See :func:`compute_path_length` for more details on
        the two policies.
    nan_warn_threshold : float, optional
        If any point track in the data has at least (:math:`\ge`)
        this proportion of values missing, a warning will be emitted.
        Defaults to 0.2 (20%). Directly passed to :func:`compute_path_length`.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        An xarray DataArray containing the computed straightness index,
        with dimensions matching those of the input data,

    Notes
    -----
    The Euclidean distance :math:`D`, also known as the "straight-line" or
    "beeline" distance, is calculated using the first and last valid (non-NaN)
    spatial coordinates within the specified time window. This ensures that
    missing data at the exact ``start`` or ``stop`` boundaries do not nullify
    the result, provided there are valid observed positions within the slice.
