    Parameters
    ----------
    data : xarray.DataArray
        The input data representing position. This must contain
        the two symmetrical keypoints located on the left and
        right sides of the body, respectively.
    left_keypoint : str
        Name of the left keypoint, e.g., "left_ear"
    right_keypoint : str
        Name of the right keypoint, e.g., "right_ear"
    camera_view : Literal["top_down", "bottom_up"], optional
        The camera viewing angle, used to determine the upwards
        direction of the animal. Can be either ``"top_down"`` (where the
        upwards direction is [0, 0, -1]), or ``"bottom_up"`` (where the

    xarray.DataArray

        dimensions matching the input data array, but without the
        ``keypoints`` dimension.

    Notes
    -----
    To determine the forward direction of the animal, we need to specify
    (1) the right-to-left direction of the animal and (2) its upward direction.
    We determine the right-to-left direction via the input left and right
    keypoints. The upwards direction, in turn, can be determined by passing the
    ``camera_view`` argument with either ``"top_down"`` or ``"bottom_up"``. If
    the camera view is specified as being ``"top_down"``, or if no additional
    information is provided, we assume that the upwards direction matches that
    of the vector ``[0, 0, -1]``. If the camera view is ``"bottom_up"``, the
    upwards direction is assumed to be given by ``[0, 0, 1]``. For both cases,
    we assume that position values are expressed in the image coordinate
    system (where the positive X-axis is oriented to the right, the positive
    Y-axis faces downwards, and positive Z-axis faces away from the person
    viewing the screen).

    If one of the required pieces of information is missing for a frame (e.g.,
    the left keypoint is not visible), then the computed head direction vector
    is set to NaN.
