    Regions of interest can be either 1 or 2 dimensional, and are represented
    by appropriate ``shapely.Geometry`` objects depending on which. Note that
    there are a number of discussions concerning subclassing ``shapely``
    objects;

    - https://github.com/shapely/shapely/issues/1233.
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10788976/how-do-i-properly-inherit-from-a-superclass-that-has-a-new-method

    To avoid the complexities of subclassing ourselves, we simply elect to wrap
    the appropriate ``shapely`` object in the ``_shapely_geometry`` attribute,
    accessible via the property ``region``. This also has the benefit of
    allowing us to 'forbid' certain operations (that ``shapely`` would
    otherwise interpret in a set-theoretic sense, giving confusing answers to
    users).

    This class is not designed to be instantiated directly. It can be
    instantiated, however its primary purpose is to reduce code duplication.
