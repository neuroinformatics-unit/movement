class BaseRegionOfInterest:
    """Base class for regions of interest (RoIs).

    Regions of interest can be either 1 or 2 dimensional, and are represented
    by corresponding ``shapely.Geometry`` objects.

    To avoid the complexities of subclassing ``shapely`` objects (due to them
    relying on ``__new__()`` methods, see
    https://github.com/shapely/shapely/issues/1233), we simply wrap the
    relevant ``shapely`` object in the ``_shapely_geometry`` attribute of the
    class. This is accessible via the property ``region``. This also allows us
    to forbid certain operations and make the manipulation of ``shapely``
    objects more user friendly.

    Although this class can be instantiated directly, it is not designed for
    this. Its primary purpose is to reduce code duplication.

    Notes
    -----
    A region of interest includes the points that make up its boundary and the
    points contained in its interior. This convention means that points inside
    the region will be treated as having zero distance to the region, and the
    approach vector from these points to the region will be the null vector.

    This may be undesirable in certain situations, when we explicitly want to
    find the distance of a point to the boundary of a region, for example. To
    accommodate this, most methods of this class accept a keyword argument that
    forces the method to perform all computations using only the boundary of
    the region, rather than the region itself. For polygons, this will force
    the method in question to only consider distances or closest points on the
    segments that form the (interior and exterior) boundaries. For segments,
    the boundary is considered to be just the two endpoints of the segment.

        Intended for internal use when conducting boundary angle computations,

        - From some given spatial position data, compute the "vector towards
        the region". This is typically the approach vector, but might also be
        the normal vector if we are dealing with a segment or the plane
        supported by a segment.
        - Compute the signed angle between the "vector towards the region" and
        some given reference vector, which may be constant or varying in time
        (such as an animal's heading or forward vector).
