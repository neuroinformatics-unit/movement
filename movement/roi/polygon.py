    """Representation of a two-dimensional region in the x-y plane.

    This class can be used to represent polygonal regions or subregions
    of the area in which the experimental data was gathered. These might
    include the arms of a maze, a nesting area, a food source, or other
    similar areas of the experimental enclosure that have some significance.

    An instance of this class can be used to represent these regions of
    interest (RoIs) in an analysis. The basic usage is to construct an
    instance of this class by passing in a list of points, which will then be
    joined (in sequence) by straight lines between consecutive pairs of points,
    to form the exterior boundary of the RoI. Note that the exterior boundary
    (accessible as via the ``.exterior`` property) is a (closed)
    ``LineOfInterest``, and may be treated accordingly.

    The class also supports holes - subregions properly contained inside the
    region that are not part of the region itself. These can be specified by
    the ``holes`` argument, and define the interior boundaries of the region.
    These interior boundaries are accessible via the ``.interior_boundaries``
    property, and the polygonal regions that make up the holes are accessible
    via the ``holes`` property.
