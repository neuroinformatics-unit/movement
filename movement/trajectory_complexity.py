"""Compute trajectory complexity measures.

This module provides functions to compute various measures of trajectory
complexity, which quantify how straight or tortuous a path is. These metrics
are useful for analyzing animal movement patterns across space.

    """Compute the straightness index of a trajectory.

    The straightness index is defined as the ratio of the Euclidean distance
    between the start and end points of a trajectory to the total path length.
    Values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfectly straight path,
    and values closer to 0 indicate more tortuous paths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : xarray.DataArray
        The input data containing position information, with ``time``
        and ``space`` (in Cartesian coordinates) as required dimensions.
    start : float, optional
        The start time of the trajectory. If None (default),
        the minimum time coordinate in the data is used.
    stop : float, optional
        The end time of the trajectory. If None (default),
        the maximum time coordinate in the data is used.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        An xarray DataArray containing the computed straightness index,
        with dimensions matching those of the input data,
        except ``time`` and ``space`` are removed.

    Notes
    -----
    The straightness index (SI) is calculated as:

    SI = Euclidean distance / Path length

    where the Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between the
    start and end points, and the path length is the total distance traveled
    along the trajectory.
