# Confidence Score Calibration in Movement
This module implements confidence calibration techniques for pose estimation frameworks supported by Movement (DeepLabCut, SLEAP, etc.). Miscalibrated confidence scores can lead to inaccurate interpretations of model predictions. The goal of this project is to improve the reliability of these scores by implementing and evaluating calibration techniques
