# Generate the documentation on all merges to main, all pull requests, or by
# manual workflow dispatch. The build job can be used as a CI check that the
# docs still build successfully. The deploy job which moves the generated
# html to the gh-pages branch and triggers a GitHub pages deployment
# only runs when a tag is pushed or when the workflow is manually dispatched
# from the main branch.
