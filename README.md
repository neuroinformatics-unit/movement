# movement

Python tools for analysing body movements across space and time, to aid the study of animal behaviour in neuroscience.

## Overview

Pose estimation tools, such as [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) are now commonplace when processing video data of animal behaviour. There is not yet a standardised, easy-to-use way to process the pose tracks produced from these software packages.

movement aims to provide a consistent modular interface to analyse pose tracks, allowing steps such as data cleaning, visualisation and motion quantification.
We aim to support a range of pose estimation packages, along with 2D or 3D tracking of single or multiple animals.

Find out more on our [mission and scope](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/community/mission-scope.html) statement and our [roadmap](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/community/roadmap.html).

## Status
> **Warning**
> - üèóÔ∏è The package is currently in early development. Stay tuned ‚åõ
> - It is not sufficiently tested to be used for scientific analysis
> - The interface is subject to changes.
