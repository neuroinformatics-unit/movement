# movement

A Python toolbox for analysing animal body movements across space and time.


![](docs/source/_static/movement_overview.png)

## Quick install

Create and activate a conda environment with movement installed:
```
conda create -n movement-env -c conda-forge movement
conda activate movement-env
```

> [!Note]
> Read the [documentation](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev) for more information, including [full installation instructions](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/getting_started/installation.html) and [examples](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/examples/index.html).

## Overview

Machine learning-based tools such as
[DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and
[SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) have become commonplace for tracking the
movements of animals and their body parts in videos.
However, there is still a need for a standardized, easy-to-use method
to process the tracks generated by these tools.

`movement` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analyzing
motion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualization,
and motion quantification. We aim to support a range of animal tracking
frameworks, as well as 2D or 3D tracking of single or multiple individuals.

> [!Warning]
> 🏗️ The package is currently in early development and the interface is subject to change. Feel free to play around and provide feedback.

> [!Tip]
> If you prefer analysing your data in R, we recommend checking out the
> [animovement](https://www.roald-arboel.com/animovement/) toolbox, which is similar in scope.
> We are working together with its developer
> to gradually converge on common data standards and workflows.
