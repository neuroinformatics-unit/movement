## Status
> **Warning**
> - üèóÔ∏è The package is currently in early development. Stay tuned ‚åõ
> - It is not sufficiently tested to be used for scientific analysis
> - The interface is subject to changes.

## Aims
* Load pose tracks from pose estimation software packages (e.g. [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) or [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/))
* Evaluate the quality of the tracks and perform data cleaning operations
* Calculate kinematic variables (e.g. speed, acceleration, joint angles, etc.)
* Produce reports and visualise the results
