We see that the dataset contains a single individual (a wasp) with two
keypoints tracked in 2D space. The video was recorded at 40 fps and lasts for
~27 seconds.

Define a plotting function
--------------------------
Let's define a plotting function to help us visualise the effects smoothing
both in the time and frequency domains.
The function takes as inputs two datasets containing raw and smooth data
respectively, and plots the position time series and power spectral density
(PSD) for a given individual and keypoint. The function also allows you to
specify the spatial coordinate (``x`` or ``y``) and a time range to focus on.

Smoothing with a median filter

Here we use the :py:func:`movement.filtering.median_filter` function to
apply a rolling window median filter to the wasp dataset.
The ``window_length`` parameter is defined in seconds (according to the
``time_unit`` dataset attribute).

We see that the median filter has removed the "spikes" present around the
14 second mark in the raw data. However, it has not dealt the big shift
occurring during the final second. In the frequency domain, we can see that
the filter has reduced the power in the high-frequency components, without
affecting the low frequency components.

This illustrates what the median filter is good at: removing brief "spikes"
(e.g. a keypoint abruptly jumping to a different location for a frame or two)
and high-frequency "jitter" (often present due to pose estimation
working on a per-frame basis).

Choosing parameters for the median filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can control the behaviour of :py:func:`movement.filtering.median_filter`
via two parameters: ``window_length`` and ``min_periods``.
To better understand the effect of these parameters, let's use a
dataset that contains missing values.

The report informs us that the raw data contains NaN values, most of which
occur at the ``snout`` and ``tail_end`` keypoints. After filtering, the
number of NaNs has increased. This is because the default behaviour of the
median filter is to propagate NaN values, i.e. if any value in the rolling
window is NaN, the output will also be NaN.

To modify this behaviour, you can set the value of the ``min_periods``
parameter to an integer value. This parameter determines the minimum number
of non-NaN values required in the window for the output to be non-NaN.
For example, setting ``min_periods=2`` means that two non-NaN values in the
window are sufficient for the median to be calculated. Let's try this.

We see that the filtered time series is much smoother and it has even
"bridged" over some small gaps. That said, it often deviates from the raw
data, in ways that may not be desirable, depending on the application.
That means that our choice of ``window_length`` may be too large.
In general, you should choose a ``window_length`` that is small enough to
preserve the original data structure, but large enough to remove
"spikes" and high-frequency noise. Always inspect the results to ensure
that the filter is not removing important features.

Smoothing with a Savitzky-Golay filter
--------------------------------------
Here we use the :py:func:`movement.filtering.savgol_filter` function,
which is a wrapper around :py:func:`scipy.signal.savgol_filter`.
The Savitzky-Golay filter is a polynomial smoothing filter that can be
applied to time series data on a rolling window basis. A polynomial of
degree ``polyorder`` is fitted to the data in each window of length
``window_length``, and the value of the polynomial at the center of the
window is used as the output value.

Let's try it on the mouse dataset.

We see that the number of NaN values has increased after filtering. This is
for the same reason as with the median filter (in its default mode), i.e.
if there is at least one NaN value in the window, the output will be NaN.
Unlike the median filter, the Savitzky-Golay filter does not provide a
``min_periods`` parameter to control this behaviour. Let's visualise the
effects in the time and frequency domains.

This example shows two important limitations of the Savitzky-Golay filter.
First, the filter can introduce artefacts around sharp boundaries. For
example, focus on what happens around the sudden drop in position
during the final second. Second, the PSD appears to have large periodic
drops at certain frequencies. Both of these effects vary with the
choice of ``window_length`` and ``polyorder``. You can read more about these
and other limitations of the Savitzky-Golay filter in
`this paper <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.1c00054>`_.

Combining multiple smoothing filters
------------------------------------
You can also combine multiple smoothing filters by applying them
sequentially. For example, we can first apply the median filter with a small
``window_length`` to remove "spikes" and then apply the Savitzky-Golay filter
with a larger ``window_length`` to further smooth the data.
Between the two filters, we can interpolate over small gaps to avoid the
excessive proliferation of NaN values. Let's try this on the mouse dataset.
First, let's apply the median filter.
