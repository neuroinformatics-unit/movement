We can see that this dataset contains the 2D pose tracks and confidence
scores for a single wasp, generated with DeepLabCut. There are 2 keypoints:
"head" and "stinger".

Visualise the pose tracks

We can see that the pose tracks contain some implausible "jumps", such
as the the big shift in the final second, and the "spikes" of the stinger
near the 14th second. Perhaps we can get rid of those based on the model's
reported confidence scores?

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-53

Visualise confidence scores
---------------------------
The confidence scores are stored in the ``confidence`` data variable.
Since the predicted poses in this example have been generated by DeepLabCut,
the confidence scores should be likelihood values between 0 and 1.
That said, confidence scores are not standardised across pose
estimation frameworks, and their ranges can vary. Therefore,
it's always a good idea to inspect the actual confidence values in the data.

Let's first look at a histogram of the confidence scores.

Based on the above histogram, we can confirm that the confidence scores
indeed range between 0 and 1, with most values closer to 1. Now let's see how
they evolve over time.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-63

.. code-block:: Python


    confidence = ds.confidence.sel(individuals="individual_0")
    confidence.plot.line(x="time", row="keypoints", aspect=2, size=2.5)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-67

Encouragingly, some of the drops in confidence scores do seem to correspond
to the implausible jumps and spikes we had seen in the pose tracks.
We can use that to our advantage.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-77

Filter out points with low confidence
-------------------------------------
We can filter out points with confidence scores below a certain threshold.
Here, we use ``threshold=0.6``. Points in the ``pose tracks`` data variable
with confidence scores below this threshold will be converted to NaN.
The ``print_report`` argument, which is True by default, reports the number
of NaN values in the dataset before and after the filtering operation.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-80

.. code-block:: Python


    ds_filtered = filter_by_confidence(ds, threshold=0.6, print_report=True)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    Missing points (marked as NaN) in input dataset:
            Individual: individual_0
                    head: 0/1085 (0.0%)
                    stinger: 0/1085 (0.0%)

    Missing points (marked as NaN) in filtered dataset:
            Individual: individual_0
                    head: 121/1085 (11.2%)
                    stinger: 93/1085 (8.6%)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-83

We can see that the filtering operation has introduced NaN values in the
``pose_tracks`` data variable. Let's visualise the filtered pose tracks.

    pose_tracks_filtered = ds_filtered.pose_tracks.sel(individuals="individual_0")

Here we can see that gaps have appeared in the pose tracks, some of which
are over the implausible jumps and spikes we had seen earlier. Moreover,
most gaps seem to be brief, lasting < 1 second.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-103

Interpolate over missing values
-------------------------------
We can interpolate over the gaps we've introduced in the pose tracks.
Here we use the default linear interpolation method and ``max_gap=1``,
meaning that we will only interpolate over gaps of 1 second or shorter.
Setting ``max_gap=None`` would interpolate over all gaps, regardless of
their length, which should be used with caution as it can introduce
spurious data. The ``print_report`` argument acts as described above.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-108

.. code-block:: Python


    ds_interpolated = interpolate_over_time(
        ds_filtered, method="linear", max_gap=1, print_report=True
    )





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

                    stinger: 93/1085 (8.6%)

    Missing points (marked as NaN) in interpolated dataset:
            Individual: individual_0

                    stinger: 0/1085 (0.0%)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-111

We see that all NaN values have disappeared, meaning that all gaps were
indeed shorter than 1 second. Let's visualise the interpolated pose tracks

Log of processing steps
-----------------------
So, far we've processed the pose tracks first by filtering out points with
low confidence scores, and then by interpolating over missing values.
The order of these operations and the parameters with which they were
performed are saved in the ``log`` attribute of the dataset.
This is useful for keeping track of the processing steps that have been
applied to the data.
