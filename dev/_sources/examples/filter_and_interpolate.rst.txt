We see that the dataset contains the 2D pose tracks and confidence scores
for a single wasp, generated with DeepLabCut. The wasp is tracked at two
keypoints: "head" and "stinger" in a video that was recorded at 40 fps and
lasts for approximately 27 seconds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-36

Visualise the pose tracks
-------------------------
Since the data contains only a single wasp, we use
:meth:`xarray.DataArray.squeeze` to remove
the dimension of length 1 from the data (the ``individuals`` dimension).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-41

We can see that the pose tracks contain some implausible "jumps", such
as the big shift in the final second, and the "spikes" of the stinger
near the 14th second. Perhaps we can get rid of those based on the model's
reported confidence scores?

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-60

Visualise confidence scores
---------------------------
The confidence scores are stored in the ``confidence`` data variable.
Since the predicted poses in this example have been generated by DeepLabCut,
the confidence scores should be likelihood values between 0 and 1.
That said, confidence scores are not standardised across pose
estimation frameworks, and their ranges can vary. Therefore,
it's always a good idea to inspect the actual confidence values in the data.

Let's first look at a histogram of the confidence scores. As before, we use
:meth:`xarray.DataArray.squeeze` to remove the ``individuals`` dimension
from the data.

Based on the above histogram, we can confirm that the confidence scores
indeed range between 0 and 1, with most values closer to 1. Now let's see how
they evolve over time.

Encouragingly, some of the drops in confidence scores do seem to correspond
to the implausible jumps and spikes we had seen in the position.
We can use that to our advantage, by leveraging functions from the
:mod:`movement.filtering` module.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-93

Filter out points with low confidence
-------------------------------------
Using :func:`movement.filtering.filter_by_confidence`,
we can filter out points with confidence scores below a certain threshold.
This function takes ``position`` and ``confidence`` as required arguments,
and accepts an optional ``threshold`` parameter,
which defaults to ``threshold=0.6`` unless specified otherwise.
Setting ``print_report=True``, will make the function print a report
on the number of NaN values before and after the filtering operation.
This is ``False`` by default, but can be useful for understanding
and debugging the impact of filtering on the data.

We will use :meth:`xarray.Dataset.update` to update ``ds`` in-place
with the filtered ``position``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 93-102

.. code-block:: Python


    ds.update(
        {
            "position": filter_by_confidence(
                ds.position, ds.confidence, print_report=True
            )
        }

    individual_0  121/1085 (11.15%)  93/1085 (8.57%)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-105

We can see that the filtering operation has introduced NaN values in the
``position`` data variable. Let's visualise the filtered data.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-110

    ds.position.squeeze().plot.line(

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 111-115

Here we can see that gaps (consecutive NaNs) have appeared in the
pose tracks, some of which are over the implausible jumps and spikes we had
seen earlier. Moreover, most gaps seem to be brief,
lasting < 1 second (or 40 frames).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 117-126

Interpolate over missing values
-------------------------------
Using  :func:`movement.filtering.interpolate_over_time`, we can
interpolate over gaps we've introduced in the pose tracks.
Here we use the default linear interpolation method (``method="linear"``)
and interpolate over gaps of 40 frames or less (``max_gap=40``).
The default ``max_gap=None`` would interpolate over all gaps, regardless of
their length, but this should be used with caution as it can introduce
spurious data. The ``print_report`` argument acts as described above.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-135

.. code-block:: Python


    ds.update(
        {
            "position": interpolate_over_time(

            )

    individual_0  15/1085 (1.38%)  15/1085 (1.38%)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-139

We see that most, but not all, NaN values have disappeared, meaning that
most gaps were indeed shorter than 40 frames.
Let's visualise the interpolated pose tracks.

.. note::
  By default, interpolation does not apply to gaps at either end of the time
  series. In our case, the last few frames removed by filtering were not
  replaced by interpolation. Passing ``fill_value="extrapolate"`` to the
  :func:`interpolate_over_time()<movement.filtering.interpolate_over_time>`
  function would extrapolate the data to also fill the gaps at either end.

  In general, you may pass any keyword arguments that are acceptable as
  ``**kwargs`` by :meth:`xarray.DataArray.interpolate_na`, which in turn
  passes them to its underlying interpolation methods.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-165

Log of processing steps
-----------------------
So, far we've processed the pose tracks first by filtering out points with
low confidence scores, and then by interpolating over missing values.
The order of these operations and the parameters with which they were
performed are saved in the ``log`` attribute of the ``position`` data array.
This is useful for keeping track of the processing steps that have been
applied to the data. Let's inspect the log:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 165-168

    print(ds.position.log)

If you want to retrieve a certain parameter from the log, you can use
:func:`json.loads` to parse the log string into a list of dictionaries.

Filtering multiple data variables
---------------------------------
We can also apply the same filtering operation to
multiple data variables in ``ds`` at the same time.

For instance, to filter both ``position`` and ``velocity`` data variables
in ``ds``, based on the confidence scores, we can specify a dictionary
with the data variable names as keys and the corresponding filtered
DataArrays as values. Then we can once again use
:meth:`xarray.Dataset.update`  to update ``ds`` in-place
with the filtered data variables.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-204

.. code-block:: Python


    # Add velocity data variable to the dataset
    ds["velocity"] = compute_velocity(ds.position)

    # Create a dictionary mapping data variable names to filtered DataArrays
    # We disable report printing for brevity
    update_dict = {
        var: filter_by_confidence(ds[var], ds.confidence)
        for var in ["position", "velocity"]
    }

    # Use the dictionary to update the dataset in-place
    ds.update(update_dict)
